# Interactive Chemical Reactions Simulator

Welcome to the Interactive Chemical Reactions Simulator repository! 
This project provides users with an engaging application where they can interact with chemical elements.
Users can choose initial elements, observe their chaotic movements on the field, and witness the formation of new elements upon collisions.
The simulation allows users to add elements, control their speed, direction, and size, as well as manipulate the surrounding environment (temperature, alkalinity, etc.).
